# TeamProfileGenerator

Welcome to the Team Profile Generator.

To begin, open a new terminal and type in "npm start". Once the application starts, you can begin to build your team! You can add as many Engineers or Interns as you would like. When you are done, you can finalize your team (Note: This current functionality is not working, will have to fix at a later date)

Below is an image of what it should look like, along with a video link on how the application is started and works:
